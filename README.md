###CSharp .Net client library for the PrestaShop API via web service

##Introduction
A simple .Net REST client written in C# for the Prestashop API.
PrestaSharp uses the RestSharp library to consume the Prestashop services.

##Basic usage
1) Initiate a client instance:

```
	string BaseUrl = "http://www.myweb.com/api";
	string Account = "ASDLKJOIQWEPROQWUPRPOQPPRQOW";
	string Password = "";
	ManufacturerFactory ManufacturerFactory = new ManufacturerFactory(BaseUrl, Account, Password);
```

2) Perform CRUD actions through the client:

```
	Bukimedia.PrestaSharp.Entities.manufacturer Manufacturer = ManufacturerFactory.Get(6);
	Manufacturer.name = "Iron Maiden";
	Manufacturer.active = 1;        
	ManufacturerFactory.Add(Manufacturer);
	ManufacturerFactory.Update(Manufacturer);
	ManufacturerFactory.Delete(Manufacturer);
```

3) Add an image:

```
	Bukimedia.PrestaSharp.Entities.product MyProduct = new Bukimedia.PrestaSharp.Entities.product()
	MyProduct = ProductFactory.Add(MyProduct)
	ImageFactory.AddProductImage((long)MyProduct.id, "C:\\MyImage.jpg");
```

##Advanced usage
1) Get all. This sample retrieves the list of manufacturers:

```
	List<manufacturer> manufacturers = ManufacturerFactory.GetAll();
```

2) Get ids. This sample retrieves the list of the manufacturer ids:

```
	List<long> ids = ManufacturerFactory.GetIds();
```

3) Get by filter. This sample retrieves the list of manufacturers which name is "Metallica":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "Metallica");
	List<manufacturer> manufacturers = ManufacturerFactory.GetByFilter(dtn, null, null);
```

4) Get by filter with wildcards. This sample retrieves the manufacturers which name starts with "Metall":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "[Metall]%");
	List<manufacturer> manufacturers = ManufacturerFactory.GetByFilter(dtn, null, null);
```

5) Get ids by filter. This sample retrieves the list of the manufacturers ids which name is "Metallica":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "Metallica");
	List<long> ids = ManufacturerFactory.GetIdsByFilter(dtn, null, null);
```

6) Get ids by filter with wildcards. This sample retrieves the list of the manufacturers ids which name starts with "Metall":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "[Metall]%");
	List<long> ids = ManufacturerFactory.GetIdsByFilter(dtn, null, null);
```

7) Get by complex filter. This sample retrieves the top five manufacturers in ascendent sorting which name starts with "Metall":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "[Metall]%");
	List<manufacturer> manufacturers = ManufacturerFactory.GetByFilter(dtn, "name_ASC", "5");
```

8) Get by filter for pagination. This sample retrieves the top five manufacturers from tenth position in ascendent sorting which name starts with "Metall":

```
	Dictionary<string, string> dtn = new Dictionary<string, string>();
	dtn.Add("name", "[Metall]%");
	List<manufacturer> manufacturers = ManufacturerFactory.GetByFilter(dtn, "name_ASC", "[9,5]");
```
